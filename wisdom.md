Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.
-- _Cat's Cradle_, Kurt Vonnegut

Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.
-- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Deep in the unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic. -- _Dune_, Frank Herbert

"Give as few orders as possible," his father had told him... once... long ago. "Once you've given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on that subject." -- _Dune_, Frank Herbert

"Any meeting with more than 2 participants is a performance."
-- I don't recall who said this, but it is definitely true.

"Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving." â€•- Terry Pratchett

"I cannot judge what he did, because I did not have his information." -- Lee Kuan Yew

"That was when Father had told Draco about the Rule of Three, which was that any plot which required more than three different things to happen would never work in real life. Father had further explained that since only a fool would attempt a plot that was as complicated as possible, the real limit was two." -- _Harry Potter and the Method of Rationality_, Eliezer Yudkowsky

"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system." -- [John Gall](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:gall_s_law)

"Jim, you can't beat something with nothing." -- Pierre Sprey, as told by James G. Burton in _Pentagon Wars_

One of the first interesting experiences I had in this project at Princeton was meeting great men. I had never met very many great men before. But there was an evaluation committee that had to try to help us along, and help us ultimately decide which way we were going to separate the uranium. This committee had men like Compton and Tolman and Smyth and Urey and Rabi and Oppenheimer on it. I would sit in because I understood the theory of how our process of separating isotopes worked, so they'd ask me questions and talk about it. In these discussions, one man would make a point. Then Compton, for example, would explain a different point of view. He would say it should be this way, and he was perfectly right. Another guy would say, well, maybe, but there is this other possibility that we have to consider against it.

So everybody is disagreeing, all around the table. I am surprised and disturbed that Compton doesn't repeat and emphasize his point. Finally, at the end, Tolman, who's the chairman, would say, "Well, having heard all these arguments, I guess it's true that Compton's argument is the best of all, and now we have to go ahead."

It was such a shock to me to see that a committee of men could present a whole lot of ideas, each one thinking of a new facet, while remembering what the other fella said, so that, at the end, the decision is made as to which idea was the best---summing it all up---without having to say it three times. These were very great men indeed.
