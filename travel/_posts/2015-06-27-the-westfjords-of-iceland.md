# 19 June 2015: Breiðafjörður
***3:30pm***

The switchbacks on the mountain roads are so steep that Heather practically has to put her cheek down on the steering wheel to see up the road. We haven't driven on pavement in hours and have only passed a handful of other vehicles. The roads on top of the mountain passes weave through giant piles of snow and past roaring waterfalls and rivers. This was the rugged Iceland we'd been dreaming of, and then some.

To get to the Westfjords, you have to leave Iceland's Ring Road, the primary route that takes people around the country. Once you leave, the roads quickly turn to packed gravel and dirt, and the road crosses fjords by either traveling their entire length twice (one on each side) or leaping over the mountain itself via an insanely steep and rugged pass. Few fjords have more than a handful of houses, and petrol stations are few and far between.

At every turn, the sheep of Iceland are watching.

## 10am: Látrabjarg Bird Cliffs
A hanging glacial valley stands high above the ocean. Its edges rise sharply before ending in sheer cliffs up to 400 meters tall. They look like the world's boldest bicycle ramps.

Inhabiting the cliffs are thousands and thousands of nesting sea birds in a constant swarm of activity. They hover over the waves by the hundreds, fishing for their next meals. They squawk and chatter in packs on the cliffs.

The peninsula is extremely remote, a tough 1.5-hour drive from our campground over rutted mountain roads, and we pass only a handful of other cars. We arrive early enough to have the area to ourselves for the better part of two hours. The views are stunning and the birdwatching is incredible.

Heather can't resist a selfie session with a puffin.

## 4pm: Race to Ísafjörður
Never believe what an Icelander from the Westfjords tells you about travel time.

The next phase of our trip was due to begin in Ísafjörður at 5pm, with a boat ride to the remote Hornstrandir peninsula for a week of wilderness camping. The folks at our campsite told us that Ísafjörður was a 1.5-hour drive. It took us nearly twice that long, at 3 hours.

The roads of the Westfjords are insane. This particular stretch started with a long, steady climb into the mountains, where we passed miles of snowfields and roaring waterfalls, bounced through innumerable potholes, and passed more than a few cargo trucks. A guard-rail-free descent into a fjord followed and the entire process repeated several times.

When you need to cover a lot of ground, you sometimes have to skip things along the way. We regrettably didn't get much time with the massive waterfall Dynjandi, but we stopped long enough to dance for it, and could see it clearly for the following half-hour of driving.

Seriously, people standing near the foot of the falls looked like ants standing under a shower.

## 8pm: Sailing into the Wild
***Veiðileysufjörður***

"Where are you planning to go?" our Austrian shipmate asked us once we were ashore in Veiðileysufjörður, 4 lone humans on a remote fjord in the middle of nowhere.

"To Hornvik tomorrow for a couple nights, then to Hlöðuvík..."

"No, you cannot cross there," she interjected. "It's impassible with ice and snow. Did you talk with the information office in Ísafjörður?"

The ferry boat sailed into the distance.

Crap.

We had barely arrived in Ísafjörður in time to catch the 5pm ferry at all, much less visit the information office. Now we wondered if we'd gotten ourselves in over our heads. The mountains were already taller and more snow-covered than we'd expected. Now this news.

After sharing the alternate route they had planned, which included two extra mountain crossings (one of which hadn't been crossed yet this year), our Austrian friends marched off to Hafnarskarð Pass, which was not just completely covered in clouds, but actually had clouds billowing down its slopes.

So they think they'll be okay with their new plan, but they're from AUSTRIA. Austria is all MOUNTAINS.

We set up our campsite, start making dinner, and try to enjoy the view. And begin working on a strategy.

## 8:30am Lessons from the Swiss
***Veiðileysufjörður***
Things said by the Swiss man who hiked into our fjord late last night:

"I passed your Austrian friends. They want me to tell you that the way from Hornvik to Hlöðuvik is open. We crossed three days ago."

"The pass is a bit tricky, because you will not cross in the usual place. Do you have a GPS? I can give you the coordinates."

"You must find this ridge here, then slowly walk down until you can see the path below, across the snowfield. You won't be able to see it from the top."

"Your map doesn't look the same as mine."

"You must be careful when you come over the snow, because if you're too far north, then you come out over the cliff."

"Are you sure that your GPS doesn't support coordinates in Decimal Minutes?"

"Some of the snow bridges over the rivers are getting unstable. It would really be a shame to fall in."

"Do you have binoculars?"

"No?"

"Really good eyesight?"

So it sounds like the pass is open, but that's according to a man from Switzerland. Switzerland is all mountains.

We'll find out in about 3 days time when we get to that mountain pass. Until then, we'll have plenty of time to worry about it. Today we tackle our first mountain pass: Hafnarskarð.

## 12:00pm First Pass: Hafnarskarð
***Hafnarskarð***

The fog is so thick, and the snow fields so long, that by the time we reach the top of the pass the only things that can be seen are your partner and a set of footprints leading uphill into oblivion.

Hornstrandir consists of several fjords, each unique. Traveling from one to another means traversing the mountains in between. Our itinerary includes visits to 5 of them.

As we begin our first mountain crossing, we see that the slopes are covered by clouds, just as they were yesterday. The trail is marked by cairns (tall stacks of rocks) that guide the way at intervals of about 100 meters. The first few miles are clear, and we can see pretty well back into Veiðileysufjörður, even though we can't see the upper parts of the slope we're climbing. Some small snowfields bridge streams, and we cross them cautiously.

Several hours in, we begin to lose visibility as we enter the clouds. The snowfields grow in size, until we feel as if we're walking from rocky island to rocky island across ever-extending patches of snow.

Before long, the fog is so thick that we cannot see the next islands at all. In some areas, only the footprints of our Swiss and Austrian friends are visible to guide us.

No sky, no ground, no rocks, no markers, no other people.

## 5:00pm Topping Out and Heading Down
***Hafnarskarð***

The top of the pass comes as a relief. The final snowfield took over 30 minutes to traverse, most of it at a sharp uphill angle. Out of the mist comes a huge pile of rocks: the cairn marking the top of the pass. We take a break for lunch, which includes Goo Goo Clusters that we brought from our home in Nashville.

The descent on the other side of the pass is nearly as steep and just as foggy. But just 30 minutes into our descent, the fog lifts and we get a clear view into the fjord, including a glimpse of the Horn itself, the peninsula that we'll explore all day tomorrow. Its sloping cliffs are exotic and alluring.

The fog returns within an hour and doesn't lift for the rest of the trip into Hornvik. Once we reach the valley, it has a magical, mysterious feel to it.
