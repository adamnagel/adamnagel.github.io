## Excerpts

### The Mind of War: John Boyd and American Security
P.141 “As the number of events to consider increases, the longer it takes to observe, orient, decide, and act. 
This suggests that faster tempo or rhythm at lower levels should work within the slower rhythm but larger pattern at higher levels so that the overall system does not lose its cohesion and coherency. Harmonizing these disparate rhythms is accomplished by giving the lower level commanders wide freedom to shape and direct their own activities within a larger pattern of the commanders intent.
The mission concept must be completely understood throughout the organization. This is what fixes responsibility and shapes of commitment, not real time command and control."

### Assassin's Apprentice
p140. "The news must run ahead to Kevlar, and to Shemshy. The imperial hand is about to reconcile their differences. They must both be left wishing they had never had any differences at all. That is the trick of good government. To make folk desire to live in such a way that there is no need for its intervention.”
