### The Mind of War: John Boyd and American Security
P.141 
>As the number of events to consider increases, the longer it takes to observe, orient, decide, and act. 
This suggests that faster tempo or rhythm at lower levels should work within the slower rhythm but larger pattern at higher levels so that the overall system does not lose its cohesion and coherency. Harmonizing these disparate rhythms is accomplished by giving the lower level commanders wide freedom to shape and direct their own activities within a larger pattern of the commanders intent.
>The mission concept must be completely understood throughout the organization. This is what fixes responsibility and shapes of commitment, not real time command and control.

p. 163
> The key points he took from this review [of military history] are that war involved friction [...] Friction is amplified by such factors as menace, ambiguity, deception, rapidity, uncertainty, and mistrust, among others. Implicit understanding, trust, cooperation, and simplicity can dimish friction. For Boyd, the key point was that variety and rapidity tend to magnify friction, while harmony and initiative tend to dimish friction. More particularly, variety and rapidity without harmony and initiative lead to confusion, disorder, and finally chaos. On the other hand, harmony and initiative without variety and rapidity lead to rigid uniformity, predictability, and finally nonadaptability. What fosters harmony and initiative and destroys variety and rapidity? Activities that promote correlation, commonality, and accurate information flows are beneficial. Compartmentalization, disconnected data flows, and plans laid out as recipes to be followed are not.

p. 168
> Boyd's briefings were essentially a dialogue with the audience. A natural teacher, he understood that if he told you something, he robbed you of the opportunity to ever truly know it for yourself. He was skilled at asking a series of leading questions to guide the group's thinking about relationships so that they would figure the lesson out just before he had to tell them. In so doing, he demonstrated the kind of thinking that he sought to demand from others [...] He then urged them to continue the process, manke their own connections, and continue the spiral of conceptual insights.


### Assassin's Apprentice
p140
>The news must run ahead to Kevlar, and to Shemshy. The imperial hand is about to reconcile their differences. They must both be left wishing they had never had any differences at all. That is the trick of good government. To make folk desire to live in such a way that there is no need for its intervention.
