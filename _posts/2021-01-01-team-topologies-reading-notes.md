## Chapter 1: Teams as the Means of Delivery
**pg 11:** ...[S]print planning for the now eight-person-strong team was a mix and match of requests across their stack of responsibilities. Prioritization was hard, and the frequent context switching even throughout a single sprint led to a dip in people's motivation. _This is not surprising if we consider Dan Pink's three elements of intrinsic motivation: **autonomy** (quashed by constant juggling of requests and priorities from multiple teams), **mastery** ("jack of all trades, master of none"), and **purpose** (too many domains of responsibility)._

**pg 13:** The goal of _Team Topologies_ is to give you the approach and mental tools to enable your organization to adapt and dynamically find the places and timing when collaboration is needed, as well as when it is best to focus on execution and reduce communication overhead. 

## Chapter 2: Conway's Law and Why It Matters
**pg 24:** One key implication of Conway's law is that not all communication and collaboration is good. Thus it is important to define "team interfaces" to set expectations around what kind of work requires strong collaboration and what doesn't. Many organizations assume that more communication is always better, but this is not really the case.

What we need is _focused_ communication between specific teams. _**We need to look for unexpected communication and address the cause**. (emphasis mine)_ 

**pg 29:** Team collaboration is important for gray areas of development, where discovery and expertise is needed to make progress. But in areas where execution prevails -- not discovery -- communication becomes an unnecessary overhead.

## Chapter 3
**pg 32:** In this book, "team" has a very specific meaning... a stable grouping of 5 to 9 people who work towared a shared goal as a unit. _**We consider the team to be the smallest entity of delivery within the organization**_. Therefore, an organization should never assign work to individuals; only to teams.

**pg 40:** _Analysis of sources of "cognitive load" is useful here._

**pg 40:** If we stress the team by giving it responsibility for part of the system that is beyond its cognitive load capacity, it ceases to act like a high-performing team and starts to behave like a loosely associated group of individuals, each trying to accomplish their individual tasks without the space to consider if those are in the team's best interest.

**pg 41:** A simple and wuick way to assess cognitive load is to ask the team, in a non-judgemental way: "Do you feel like you're effective and able to respond in a timely fashion to the work you are asked to do?" While not an accurate measure, the answer will help gauge whether teams are feeling overloaded.

**pg 42**: _Good case study on managing cognitive load by breaking into microteams._

This chapter also brings up the idea of _guilds_ around certain specialties to share knowledge and leaning.

**pg 56:** [T]echnology teams need to invest in proven team practices like continuous delivery, test-first development, and a focus on software operability and releasability. Without them, all the effort invested in a team-first approach to work and flow will be greatly undermined or at least underachieved.

## Chapter 4
**pg 68:** The key for the team to remain autonomous is for external dependencies to be non-blocking, meaning that new features don't sit idle, waiting for something to happen beyond the control of the team.

**pg 70:** [T]here needs to be a split between the responsibility of designing the cloud infrastructure process (by the cloud team) and the actual provisioning and updates to the application resources (by the product teams).

NOTE: This can be generalized -- one team decides how it should work, so others can work it autonomously.
