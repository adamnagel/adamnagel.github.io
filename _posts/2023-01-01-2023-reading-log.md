## Excerpts

### The Golden Fool
> It was a long involved story, full of detail, and I let it stream gently past me. Fennel came to my chair, stood pu and dug his front claws into my leg, then hauled himself up into my lap. From there, he surveyed the table.
> 
> _Butter for the cat._
> 
> _I have no reason to be nice to you._
> 
> _Yes you do. I am the cat_
> 
> He was so supremely self-confident that that was enough reason for me to butter a corner of a slice of break and offer it to him.

> Silence asks the questions that are too awkward to phrase. It even asks the questions one does not know to ask.

> Strange, how being left out of a secret always feels like a betrayal of trust.

> "So stop bemoaning what a mess you've made, and start demanding that Hap take responsibility for himself." She settled herself deeper into her chair. As if to herself, she added, "You're quite enough messes of your own to clean up, without claiming responsibility for everyone else's."
> 
> I stared at her in amazement.

> Tonight, when he comes back, I'm telling him that I'm turning him out of my house, because I don't want trouble to come calling at my door." She laughed aloud at the look on my face. "It's called a consequence, Tom. Hap should feel more of them. And when he comes moaning to you, I think you should let him deal with it on his own."
