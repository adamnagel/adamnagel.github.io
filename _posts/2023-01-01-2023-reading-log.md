> Luisa chuckled. "I hear you, sugar. I'm not gonna say you're wrong. But I have to warn you that this is the word -- politics -- that nerds use whenever they feel impatient about the human realities of an organization."

### The Golden Fool
> It was a long involved story, full of detail, and I let it stream gently past me. Fennel came to my chair, stood pu and dug his front claws into my leg, then hauled himself up into my lap. From there, he surveyed the table.
> 
> _Butter for the cat._
> 
> _I have no reason to be nice to you._
> 
> _Yes you do. I am the cat_
> 
> He was so supremely self-confident that that was enough reason for me to butter a corner of a slice of break and offer it to him.

> Silence asks the questions that are too awkward to phrase. It even asks the questions one does not know to ask.

> Strange, how being left out of a secret always feels like a betrayal of trust.

> "So stop bemoaning what a mess you've made, and start demanding that Hap take responsibility for himself." She settled herself deeper into her chair. As if to herself, she added, "You're quite enough messes of your own to clean up, without claiming responsibility for everyone else's."
> 
> I stared at her in amazement.

> Tonight, when he comes back, I'm telling him that I'm turning him out of my house, because I don't want trouble to come calling at my door." She laughed aloud at the look on my face. "It's called a consequence, Tom. Hap should feel more of them. And when he comes moaning to you, I think you should let him deal with it on his own."

> I should have known that I could never understand him as I understood other people. Explanations had seldom worked between us. Trust had.

> Ony man armed with the right word may do what an army of swordsmen cannot. -- Mountain Proverb

### Fool's Fate
> “How do you do it?” I asked the Fool suddenly. “You shift who you are from year to year and place to place. Don’t you ever feel regret that no one truly knows you as the person you were born?” He shook his head slowly. “I am not the person I was born. Neither are you. I know no one who is. Truly, Fitz, all we ever know are facets of one another. Perhaps we feel as if we know one another well when we know several facets of that person. Father, son, brother, friend, lover, husband … a man can be all of those things, yet no one person knows him in all those roles. I watch you being Hap’s father, and yet I do not know you as I knew my father, any more than I knew my father as his brother did. So. When I show myself in a different light, I do not make a pretense. Rather I bare a different aspect to the world than they have seen before. Truly, there is a place in my heart where I am forever the Fool and your playfellow. And within me there is a genuine Lord Golden, fond of good drink and well-prepared food and elegant clothing and witty speech. And so, when I show myself as him, I am deceiving no one, but only sharing a different part of myself.”

> I would not call him an educated man, yet, as he puts it, anything he has ever decided he needed to know, he’s found a way to learn.

> “No. I don’t,” he admitted easily, but with growing outrage. “And neither do you. You go around making these monumental decisions about what other people should know or not know about their own lives. But you don’t really have any more idea how it will turn out than I do! You just do what you think is safest and then crawl around hoping no one will find out and blame you later if things go wrong!”

> [D]iplomacy is the velvet glove that cloaks the fist of power. Persuasion, not force, works best and lasts longest.

> He smiled, and reminded me that no man could make time, but only use that which he was given wisely.

### The Wise Man's Fear
> Denna watched the door close behind him. “He’s a sweet boy.” “You say that as if you regret it,” I said. “If he were a little less sweet, he might be able to fit two thoughts in his head at the same time. Maybe they would rub together and make a spark. Even a little smoke would be nice, then at least it would look like something was happening in there.”

> In each of us there is a mind we use for all our waking deeds. But there is another mind as well, a sleeping mind. It is so powerful that the sleeping mind of an eight-year-old can accomplish in one second what the waking minds of seven members of the Arcanum could not in fifteen minutes.”

> He finished the last title and took a step back, nodding to himself. There were twenty books in all. He drew stars next to three of them, underlined two others, and drew a sad face next to the last one on the list. Then he left, striding out of the room without another word, leaving us thinking on the nature of names and wondering what we had gotten ourselves into.

> I didn’t say anything to that. I must have said it quite loudly too, because Dal gave me a curious look.

> with an intent expression on his face, Dal pressed his hand deep into the heart of the fire, nestling his spread fingers into the orange coals as if they were nothing more than loose gravel. I realized I was holding my breath and let it out softly, not wanting to break his concentration. “How?” “Names,” Dal said firmly, and drew his hand back out of the fire. It was smudged with white ash, but perfectly unharmed. “Names reflect true understanding of a thing, and when you truly understand a thing you have power over it.”

> “Hold on a moment,” I said. “We’re not done. I don’t know if I could explain music without using it, but that’s beside the point. That’s not explanation, it’s translation.” Elodin’s face lit up. “That’s it exactly!” he said. “Translation. All explicit knowledge is translated knowledge, and all translation is imperfect.” “So all explicit knowledge is imperfect?” I asked. “Tell Master Brandeur geometry is subjective. I’d love to watch that discussion.” “Not all knowledge,” Elodin admitted. “But most.”

> Pride is always a better lever against the nobility than reason.

> Best of all, Tempi got to practice his Aturan while I built up my Ademic vocabulary. I noticed the more mistakes I made in his language, the more comfortable he grew in his own attempts at expressing himself. This meant, of course, that I made many mistakes. In fact, I was occasionally so thickheaded that Tempi was forced to explain himself several times in several different ways. All in Aturan of course.

> “It’s the questions we can’t answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he’ll look for his own answers.” 
>  
>  I spread my blanket on the ground and folded over the threadbare tinker’s cloak to wrap myself in. “That way, when he finds the answers, they’ll be precious to him. The harder the question, the harder we hunt. The harder we hunt, the more we learn. An impossible question...”

> 

> You find two types of mayor in small towns like this. The first type are balding, older men of considerable girth who are good with money and tend to wring their hands a great deal when anything unexpected happens. The second type are tall, broad-shouldered men whose families have grown slowly prosperous because they had worked like angry bastards behind a plow for twenty generations. Ell’s father was the second sort.
