# Day 0: Preparation
The store clerks stare at me in surprise. We're in Dublin, California and I've come into the shop to buy a toolkit and Rok tiedown straps for my duffel bag.

"You're going all the way to Nashville on a Bonnie? That's a pretty small bike. Are you traveling with someone?"

"No, just me," I reply.

"You got Bluetooth in your helmet, or you just rawdogging that too?"

I do have it. Hardly a minute of my life goes by without music playing. 

They convince me to get a 1L spare fuel bottle and a tire puncture kit.

"Hey look at those boots, those are real moto boots!"

We're standing in the midst of an impressive vintage motorcycle collection, with Indians, Harleys, and BMWs going back to the 1920s. The owner must have a million miles of motorcycling under his belt, having traversed the Baja peninsula multiple times, riding all the way to the tip of South America, and covering huge chunks of Asia from Thailand to Mongolia to Vladivostok. In a remote yurt in Asia he ate a goat's eyeball in a homemade stew before joining the whole host family in their only bed, spooning one another. He just got back from a 5000-mile ride through Canada.

"You have pants?"<br/>
"Yeah, Aerostitch pants."<br/>
"You have a jacket?"<br/>
"Yeah, perforated."<br/>
"With real pads?"<br/>
"Yeah."<br/>
"Elbows?"<br/>
"Mmm-hmm."<br/>
"Shoulders?."<br/>
"Yep. Full face helmet."<br/>
"Bluetooth? You a Cardo or SENA guy?"<br/>
"Cardo, because my in-laws have it."<br/>
"Satellite phone?"<br/>
"GPS rescue beacon, for hikers."<br/>
"Helicopter insurance?"<br/>
"No but I was going to do that today."<br/>
"Camping or hotels?"<br/>
"Both. I want to stay in the national parks in Nevada and Utah."<br/>

"I've been all over the world. I've ridden across Mongolia. Do you know how many times I slept in my tent?" he asks.

"ONCE," he answers, waving a single finger in the air.

"Any advice for the trip?" I ask the maintenance department manager. We've just talked through the notes from the shop's thorough inspection of the bike.

"Avoid the riff-raff."

"Two- or four-legged?"

"Mmmm... both," he replies.

"It's been a long time since I did a long trip," he continues. "Back when I used to ride back to Chicago."

"What's your preferred route?" I ask. I'm looking for advice on the most interesting roads.

"Super slab (interstate), all the way. 1000 miles a day, 2 1/2 days," he replies.

I stare back blankly.

"And no Bluetooth or anything. Too distracting."

# Day 1: San Jose --> Sacramento
Memories:
1. Winding up the hills of the Twin Peaks neighborhood, circling the Sutro Tower, and coming downhill with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background.
2. Taking a founders' call from the picnic area of Blue Heron Lake in Golden Gate Park.
3. Crossing the Bridge
4. Traversing the marshlands along Highway 37. A deep channel snakes through the shallows of a roadside creek.
5. A military [Osprey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey) flying over the highway near Travis AFB.
5. Filtering through backed-up interstate traffic for hours.
6. The new cruise control is **perfect**.

# Day 2: Down Day in Sacramento


# Day 3: Sacramento to Tahoe (via Golden Lake)
Memories:
1. The smooth morning air heading north on CA-90, passing groves of olive trees stretching across the flat plain.
2. The prominent, but isolated, volcanic area on the horizon near Yuba City.
3. Weaving through deep river valleys with postcard-perfect mountain streams.
4. Casually looking behind me, being instantly astonished by the view, and immediately pulling over to have a better look.
5. Riding across a high, flat plain among rounded mountain peaks, with hundreds of cattle and horses grazing on the long, brown grass.
6. An incredible wall-side parking spot above Emerald Bay.
